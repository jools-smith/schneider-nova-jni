Create your C-format client identity files using pubidutil and printbin 
and copy them here.  By default, the toolkit device examples look for a 
file called IdentityClient.h.  A local license server implementation 
requires a client-server identity file instead, where the examples use 
the name IdentityClientServer.h. 

File names may be different for your examples or custom digital 
signature algorithms.
